# ethereum-oracle-sample
Basic Ethereum Oracle example, including Oraclize, Truffle and Vue.

This is an examples on how to combine a front-end to a Ethereum oracle. So as a little side project I build a little starter pack. Hoping that it can serve as a starting point or example for other developers who want to play around with oracles!

It gets the current ETH/USD price from the Coinbase API and pulls it into the smart contract

The example includes the following technologies

Vue-cli 3.2.1
TypeScript (class style components)
Smart contract example
Oraclize
Truffle
